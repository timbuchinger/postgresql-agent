# Project Brief: PostgreSQL Agent

## Overview
A sophisticated database query system that transforms natural language questions into SQL queries and provides human-readable answers using AI agents.

## Core Requirements

1. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Accept natural language questions about database content
   - Interpret questions accurately in the context of the database schema
   - Transform questions into valid SQL queries

2. **Database Integration**
   - Connect to PostgreSQL databases securely
   - Execute SQL queries efficiently
   - Handle various data types and complex schema structures

3. **Agent Collaboration**
   - Utilize multiple specialized AI agents
   - Coordinate agent tasks effectively
   - Maintain clear communication flow between agents

4. **Answer Generation**
   - Provide accurate, human-readable answers
   - Format results clearly and concisely
   - Handle error cases gracefully

## Goals

1. **Primary Goals**
   - Enable non-technical users to query databases using natural language
   - Reduce the complexity of database interactions
   - Provide accurate and relevant answers to database queries
   - Maintain data security and query efficiency

2. **Technical Goals**
   - Build a robust and extensible agent architecture
   - Implement efficient database connection management
   - Ensure reliable query execution and error handling
   - Support schema analysis and query optimization

## Success Criteria
- Accurate translation of natural language to SQL
- Correct query execution and result interpretation
- Clear and understandable answers
- Efficient multi-agent coordination
- Reliable database connection handling
